## Description
The FractalAI V2 is an innovative AI project that implements a unique neural network structure inspired by fractal geometry. This project combines concepts from fractal mathematics, neural networks, and natural language processing to create a dynamic, self-organizing AI system.

## Key Features
- Dynamic fractal-based neural network structure
- Wikipedia-based initialization and learning
- API-driven training capabilities
- Interactive 3D visualization of the network
- Chat interface for interacting with the trained network
- Asynchronous operations for efficient data processing
- State management for saving and loading network configurations

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**: The network starts by learning from Wikipedia articles on user-specified topics.
2. **Training**: Further training is done using data from external APIs, allowing the network to expand its knowledge.
3. **Visualization**: The network's structure can be visualized in 3D, showing the fractal-like connections between neurons.
4. **Interaction**: Users can chat with the network, getting responses generated based on its learned structure.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- See `requirements.txt` for detailed library dependencies

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python app.py`

## Usage
The application provides a Gradio web interface with several tabs:
- Initialize with Wikipedia Topics
- API Training
- Visualization
- Chat
- State Management

Follow the on-screen instructions in each tab to interact with the network.
